# ADR-0002: Blockchain Integration Strategy

## Status

Accepted

## Date

2024-01-15

## Context

The Blockchain EMR system requires immutable audit trails and data integrity
verification for medical records. We need to integrate blockchain technology
while maintaining high performance (1000+ TPS) and regulatory compliance.

## Decision

We will use **Hyperledger Fabric** as our blockchain platform with the following
integration strategy:

### Blockchain Usage Pattern

- **Primary Purpose**: Audit trail and data integrity verification
- **Secondary Purpose**: Permission management and access control
- **Not Used For**: Direct storage of medical data (too expensive and slow)

### Integration Architecture

```
Medical Record Creation Flow:
1. Store encrypted data in layered storage (ADR-0001)
2. Generate cryptographic hash of the data
3. Submit hash + metadata to blockchain
4. Store blockchain transaction ID with record metadata
5. Return success to client
```

### Hyperledger Fabric Configuration

- **Network**: Private permissioned network
- **Consensus**: Raft consensus algorithm
- **Peers**: 3 organizations (Hospital, Clinic, Regulatory)
- **Channels**: Separate channels per healthcare organization
- **Chaincode**: Smart contracts for record verification and permissions

## Consequences

### Positive

- **Immutability**: Tamper-proof audit trail for all medical records
- **Compliance**: Meets regulatory requirements for data integrity
- **Trust**: Cryptographic proof of data authenticity
- **Performance**: Hash-only storage maintains high throughput
- **Privacy**: Actual medical data never stored on blockchain

### Negative

- **Complexity**: Additional infrastructure and operational overhead
- **Latency**: Blockchain writes add 2-5 seconds to record creation
- **Cost**: Infrastructure costs for blockchain network
- **Dependency**: System depends on blockchain network availability

## Implementation Details

### Smart Contract Functions

```javascript
// Record verification
verifyRecord(recordId, dataHash, timestamp);

// Permission management
grantPermission(recordId, granteeId, permission, conditions);
revokePermission(recordId, granteeId);
checkPermission(recordId, userId);

// Audit trail
getAuditTrail(recordId);
getAccessHistory(recordId);
```

### Data Structure on Blockchain

```json
{
  "recordId": "uuid",
  "dataHash": "sha256-hash",
  "patientId": "uuid",
  "doctorId": "uuid",
  "timestamp": "iso-date",
  "recordType": "consultation|diagnosis|prescription|lab_result|imaging",
  "storageLayer": 2,
  "permissions": [
    {
      "granteeId": "uuid",
      "permission": "read|write|admin",
      "grantedAt": "iso-date",
      "expiresAt": "iso-date"
    }
  ]
}
```

### Performance Optimizations

- **Async Processing**: Blockchain writes happen asynchronously
- **Batch Operations**: Multiple records batched into single transaction
- **Caching**: Blockchain query results cached in Redis
- **Read Replicas**: Multiple blockchain peers for read scaling

## Security Considerations

### Data Privacy

- Only cryptographic hashes stored on blockchain
- Patient data encrypted before hashing
- Zero-knowledge proofs for sensitive operations

### Access Control

- Blockchain-based permission verification
- Multi-signature requirements for sensitive operations
- Time-based and condition-based access controls

### Network Security

- TLS encryption for all blockchain communications
- Certificate-based authentication between peers
- Regular security audits and penetration testing

## Monitoring and Alerting

### Blockchain Health Metrics

- Transaction throughput and latency
- Peer connectivity and consensus health
- Smart contract execution success rates
- Data integrity verification results

### Business Metrics

- Record verification success rate
- Permission grant/revoke operations
- Audit trail completeness
- Compliance reporting metrics

## Disaster Recovery

### Blockchain Backup Strategy

- Regular ledger snapshots
- Peer data replication across data centers
- Smart contract backup and versioning
- Recovery procedures documented and tested

### Failover Scenarios

- Single peer failure: Automatic failover to healthy peers
- Network partition: Graceful degradation with local caching
- Complete blockchain failure: Emergency read-only mode

## Alternatives Considered

### Ethereum Public Blockchain

- **Rejected**: Too expensive for high-volume operations
- **Issues**: Gas costs, scalability limitations, privacy concerns

### Private Ethereum Network

- **Rejected**: Less mature enterprise features compared to Fabric
- **Issues**: Limited permissioning, consensus options

### Centralized Database with Checksums

- **Rejected**: Lacks immutability and third-party verification
- **Issues**: Single point of trust, no cryptographic guarantees

### IPFS with Blockchain Hashes

- **Considered**: Good for data storage but lacks smart contract capabilities
- **Issues**: Limited business logic, no built-in permissions

## Migration Strategy

### Phase 1: Parallel Operation

- Run blockchain alongside existing system
- Verify data integrity without enforcing
- Monitor performance and stability

### Phase 2: Gradual Enforcement

- Enable blockchain verification for new records
- Migrate critical existing records
- Implement permission checks

### Phase 3: Full Integration

- All operations require blockchain verification
- Decommission legacy audit systems
- Full compliance reporting

## Compliance and Regulatory

### HIPAA Compliance

- Blockchain audit trails support HIPAA audit requirements
- Access controls meet minimum necessary standard
- Data integrity verification supports security rule

### FDA Validation

- Blockchain provides required audit trail for medical devices
- Immutable records support clinical trial integrity
- Cryptographic verification meets data integrity requirements
